Following are the files important for the functioning of the software :--
	
	1. lexer_final.mll --- This is the lexer file made using the knowledge gained in assignment 2 . It scans the input file and generates suitable tokens as required by the program specifications. For further information , the file is appropriately commented to explain its  finer details.
	
	2. parser_ass6.mly --- This is the parser file which takes the tokens generated by the lexer file as input and recognizes appropriate syntax so that we can call the required functions in the file DeclareTypes.ml . For further details , see file parser_ass6.mly which is commented sufficiently.  

	3. ass6_backend.ml --- This file is the backend implementation of all the functions called in the Parser. It also has type definitions such as clause , term , substitution etc. which are useful in the parser as well.

	4. ass6_main.ml --- This file is where we integrate th whole program simply calling the lexer and then the parser on the input file to get list of rules and facts . Then we answer queries using a similar process . For more details , you can view the file and get more information from the documentation of functions.

	5. makefile --- This has a sequnce of compilation commands which finally results in the generation of an executable "assignment6" . 

	6. test1.txt --- Program has a set of rules and facts which serve as database for the program to search in . This is only for test purposes .
	                 Another other file given as input will work appropriately also . 


To run the program with a given file for example test1.txt as input database , type following commands in the Linux Terminal :--
			1. make
			2. ./assignment6 test1.txt(replace with appropriate file name)

Then type series of queries and the program will return the appropriate answers given the input database .
